# Quickstart: base

Base guide for configuring a realm

1. [Configure the realm](01-realm.md)
2. [Add an identity provider](02-idp.md)
3. [Register a client](03-client.md)
4. [Define a custom service (API)](04-custom-service.md)


By following the steps developers can obtain a fully configured realm, with users able to login either via username/password (internal provider) or via external providers. 
An external API will be registered as custom service, and the client will be authorized to consume users identities (via OpenID) and obtain authorization to access the API on behalf of users (via OAuth2).
